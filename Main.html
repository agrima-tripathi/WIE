        Despite the fact that it is still a male-dominated business, the Engineering Industry is seeing a growing number of female engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, numerous female engineers have been responsible for some of history's most significant innovations.
      </p> 
      <p>
        They don't always get the credit they deserve, though. Throughout history, engineering has been predominantly a male-dominated field (and it still is in 2021!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Women have had to overcome huge challenges and break through discriminatory barriers in addition to completing incredible exploits (such as establishing the theory that led to modern-day Wi-Fi).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog we talk about some such women.

                <label>Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who helped to develop the technology that is now used in WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. </label>
                <label>Society has long overlooked her imaginative genius as a natural beauty who has appeared in films such as Samson and Delilah and White Cargo.</label>
                <label>
                  Howard Hughes, the aviation mogul, was one of the few people who knew of Lamarr's creativity. Based on photographs of the quickest birds and fish she could locate, she advised he adapt the relatively square design of his aeroplanes (which she believed looked too slow) to a more streamlined shape.
                  During WWII, Lamarr discovered how easily radio-controlled torpedoes, a new tool in naval warfare, could be jammed and sent off course.
                  She considered generating a frequency-hopping signal that would be impossible to monitor or jam. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her design a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronising a tiny player-piano mechanism with radio signals.  They drafted plans for the frequency-hopping technology, which they patented.
                  In 'Bombshell,' the Austrian-accented LaMarr states, 'Inventions are easy for me to do.' "I don't have to think about ideas; they just come to me."

                  Edith Clarke was the first female engineer to join Tau Beta Pi as a professional member. Clarke was the first woman to be elected as a Fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1948. She was the first woman to be admitted to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers as a full voting member. Evelyn Jetter, one of SWE's founders and inventor of the automotive ignition transistor, presented her with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Achievement Award in 1954, "in appreciation of her numerous innovative contributions to stability theory and circuit analysis." In 1998, Clarke was chosen for inclusion in Women of Achievement in Maryland History, as well as American National Biography and Notable American Women of the Modern Period.

                  Kwolek received the Lavoisier Medal for excellent achievement from DuPont in 1995 for the discovery of Kevlar, as a "persistent experimentalist and role model whose discovery of liquid crystalline polyamides led to Kevlar aramid fibres." In 1980, Kwolek earned the American Institute of Chemists' Chemical Pioneer Award, as well as the American Chemical Society's Award for Creative Invention. Kwolek was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995. She was awarded the National Medal of Technology as well as the IRI Achievement Award in 1996. The American Chemical Society awarded her the Perkin Medal in 1997. She was elected to the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2003. Carnegie Mellon University (2001) and Worcester Polytechnic Institute have given her honorary degrees.

                  In 1914, Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, the only child of Gertrud "Trude" Kiesler and Emil Kiesler, was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.
                  Her father was a bank director who was born into a Galician Jewish family in Lemberg. Trude's mother, a musician and native of Budapest, came from a wealthy Hungarian Jewish family. She had become a devout Catholic.
                  Lamarr exhibited an early interest in performing and was enthralled by theatre and film as a child. She won a beauty pageant in Vienna when she was 12 years old. She began to identify invention with her father, who would take her for walks and explain how different technology in society worked.

                  Edith Clarke was born on February 10, 1883, in Howard County, Maryland, to lawyers John Ridgely Clarke and Susan Dorsey Owings. She was orphaned at the age of 12 and raised by an older sister. She utilised her money to attend Vassar College and study mathematics and astronomy, graduating in 1908.
                  Clarke taught mathematics and physics at a private school in San Francisco and at Marshall College after graduating from college. She went on to study civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left in 1912 to work for AT&T as a "computer." She worked as a calculator for George Campbell, a mathematician who specialised in long-distance electrical transfers. By night, she studied electrical engineering at Columbia University while working at AT&T.

                  In 1923, Kwolek was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, to Polish immigrant parents. John Kwolek, her father, died when she was ten years old. She credited him with sparking her interest in science, and her mother, Nellie Kwolek, a seamstress, with sparking her interest in fashion design. Kwolek decided to become a doctor after her mother told her she was too much of a perfectionist to work in the fashion industry.
                  Stephanie graduated from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College at Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1946. She wanted to be a doctor and believed that a temporary employment in a chemistry-related profession would provide her with enough money to go medical school.
