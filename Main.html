        Despite the fact that it is still a male-dominated business, the Engineering Industry is seeing a growing number of female engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, numerous female engineers have been responsible for some of history's most significant innovations.
      </p> 
      <p>
        They don't always get the credit they deserve, though. Throughout history, engineering has been predominantly a male-dominated field (and it still is in 2021!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Women have had to overcome huge challenges and break through discriminatory barriers in addition to completing incredible exploits (such as establishing the theory that led to modern-day Wi-Fi).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog we talk about some such women.

                <label>Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who helped to develop the technology that is now used in WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. </label>
                <label>Society has long overlooked her imaginative genius as a natural beauty who has appeared in films such as Samson and Delilah and White Cargo.</label>
                <label>
                  Howard Hughes, the aviation mogul, was one of the few people who knew of Lamarr's creativity. Based on photographs of the quickest birds and fish she could locate, she advised he adapt the relatively square design of his aeroplanes (which she believed looked too slow) to a more streamlined shape.
                  During WWII, Lamarr discovered how easily radio-controlled torpedoes, a new tool in naval warfare, could be jammed and sent off course.
                  She considered generating a frequency-hopping signal that would be impossible to monitor or jam. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her design a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronising a tiny player-piano mechanism with radio signals. Â They drafted plans for the frequency-hopping technology, which they patented.
                  In 'Bombshell,' the Austrian-accented LaMarr states, 'Inventions are easy for me to do.' "I don't have to think about ideas; they just come to me."
